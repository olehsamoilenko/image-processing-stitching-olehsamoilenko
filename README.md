# Computer Vision Course Assignment: Image Stitching with SIFT and RANSAC

## Overview

Welcome to the Image Stitching assignment for the Computer Vision course! In this assignment, you will explore and implement the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithms to stitch together two overlapped images.

### Task

Your objective is to:

1. Learn about the SIFT and RANSAC algorithms.
2. Acquire or create two (or more) overlapped images.
3. Use the SIFT algorithm to find keypoint matches between the images.
4. Use RANSAC to estimate the homography between the images.
5. Stitch the images together using the computed homography.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/mshamrai-teaching/image-processing-stitching-*your-name*
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
     cd image-processing-stitching-*your-name*
    ```

### Submission
To submit your solution create pull request to the `main` branch.  

Ensure your final submission includes:
* Source code (image_stitching.py\\.ipynb or similar).
* Input images, which you took.
* Output image.
* A brief report (report.md or similar) explaining your approach and any challenges faced.


Good luck, and enjoy exploring the world of image stitching! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
